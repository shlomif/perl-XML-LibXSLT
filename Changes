Revision history for Perl extension XML::LibXSLT.

1.62
     - security callback interface contributed by Shane Corgatelli
     - check libxslt version
     - added XML::LibXML-like API to retrieve libxslt version
     - added output_as_bytes() and output_as_chars()
     - added regression tests for output_as_* to 11utf8.t 
     - output_as_string documentation fixed to match reality
     - make 06entities.t to pass with older libxml2/libxslt
     - POD uses items instead of headings
     - fixed media_type and output_encoding for imported stylesheets [rt.cpan.org #23440]

1.61
     - fixed error reporting: die on fatal errors, warn otherwise
       (in particular, warn rather than die on <xsl:message terminate="no">)

1.60
     - fix a huge memory leak in transform_file (bug #1314)
     - make it clear from the docs that output_string returns bytes (bug #8875)
     - added missing type-casting to fix compile-time warnings (bug #18508)
     - using call_* instead of perl_call_* (perl_ variants are obsolete)
     - in callbacks, POPs on error before croaking, otherwise it has no
       effect (and we probably leak)
     - added test case which used to fail (provided in rt #15723)
     - apply patch for Makefile.PL for non-standard libxslt paths (bug #16224)
